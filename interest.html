              <p>Art has always been a massive part of my life and also creative activities have always drawn my attention. I remember my first painting and I remember how I wished I had more time to make it better. Even as a child I strived for the best from my work. I prefer Fine Art to anything else, as fine art to me has more potential in it to embrace the artists’ emotions and can contain more depth and concept than any other media.</p>

              <p>I have a deep and serious passion for food. Like most people, I love to eat but more importantly, I love to cook, talk about, look at and study food. I've recently discovered this new hobby of mine and if no one minds, I would like to talk about my interest. Initially, I started by just taking pictures of the great meals I was eating and keep them in my collection.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">All types of cuisine inspire me whether it is<em>European, Asian, African, Middle Eastern, or American (Latin and North America).</em> Not only cook food I’m also passionate about experiencing and travelling to various places to try new foods.</p>

Pets are also incredibly cute, which is kind of a lame point to make, but it is still is an important part as to why I feel such compassion towards pets. As a child, I always had a special spot in my heart for animals and pets. I had a dog and also some cats who were like my best friends.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">I love to travel. Ever since the I was a kid; I had a sense of adventure and always loved the adventure of traveling. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don’t live for the future or the past… just in the moment. Being impulsive and saying ‘yes’ to nearly everything is part of the fun. I traveled a lot when I was back home (Sri Lanka) and I have covered different states in America as well.

              <p>Life without a hobby is like food without the salt. It is a hobby which makes living interesting. It is a pursuit outside one’s regular work. A hobby gives one joy and pleasure; one does not get tired of it. It is a pastime, relaxation and leisure. In this way, while one is learning something, he is also making best use of his time.</p>
              <p>I have several hobbies such as watching movies, listening to music, cooking/baking and gardening.</p>
